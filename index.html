          Wise men say <br>
          "Only fools rush in" <br>
          But I can't help <br>
          Falling in love with you <br>
          Shall I stay? <br>
          Would it be a sin <br>
          If I can't help <br>
          Falling in love with you? <br>
          Like a river flows <br>
          Surely to the sea <br>
          Darling, so it goes <br>
          Some things are meant to be <br>
          Take my hand <br>
          Take my whole life too <br>
          For I can't help <br>
          Falling in love with you <br>
          Like a river flows <br>
          Surely to the sea <br>
          Darling, so it goes <br>
          Some things are meant to be <br>
          Take my hand <br>
          Take my whole life too <br>
          For I can't help <br>
          Falling in love with you <br>
          For I can't help <br>
          Falling in love with you.
